## minesweeper-ruby

A console-based version of Minesweeper, written in Ruby.  
Created just for fun (and practice)!

_Note_: Since this is a command-line game, you aren't able to mark mines like in traditional minesweeper.  
However, all the other usual rules apply.

To play: `ruby lib/minesweeper.rb`
